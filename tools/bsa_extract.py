"""Pull named files out of Skyrim SE BSAs without unpacking the archive.

VENDORED into Menu Studio 2026-08-27, from Fitting Room's tools, because
harvest_backdrops.py ships to players now and a cross-repo sys.path insert
naming a folder on one developer's disk cannot travel.

Written 2026-08-20 to answer one question about four head meshes, when
unpacking `Skyrim - Meshes0.bsa` to reach them would have cost 1.1 GB. It reads
the v105 header, walks the folder and file records, and decompresses only the
entries whose full path contains the substring asked for.

⚠ SEARCH BY SUBSTRING, AND THE PATH IS FOLDED TO LOWER CASE. Passing a leaf
name alone is usually right; pass a folder fragment too when a leaf is common.

⚠ IT SEARCHES EVERY BSA UNDER THE ROOTS GIVEN, WHICH IS HOW YOU FIND OUT WHO
WINS. A loose file beats every archive and this tool cannot see loose files, so
check for those separately before concluding vanilla's copy is the one the game
loads.

Needs lz4 (installed). BSArch is also on this machine, under the Nolvus
instance's TOOLS folder, when a full unpack really is wanted.

Usage: python bsa_extract.py <substring> <outdir> <root> [<root> ...]
