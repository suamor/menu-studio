"""Render the nine-slice frame the editor draws its chrome with.

WHY A TEXTURE AT ALL. ChamferPolicy.h names this as the escape hatch and it is
the honest one: FLICK's theme format cannot describe a cut corner, and the
quad-drawn chamfer beside it can only ever produce an octagon. Vel'dun's own
frames are Flash vector art, so the way to look like them is to draw ART rather
than to draw geometry. Vel'dun UI FLICK ships no images to borrow (two INIs, two
JSONs and a backup), and lifting another author's art out of their SWFs is a
licensing question rather than a technical one, so this generates our own.

WHY IT IS WHITE. The alpha carries the SHAPE and nothing else; the colour comes
from the tint at draw time, which is read from the live FLICK theme. A frame
with its own baked colour would be the one thing in the editor that ignores the
user's preset, which is the complaint that starts every theming thread.

WHY IT IS REGENERABLE RATHER THAN HAND-PAINTED. Every number below is a knob,
and the ones worth turning are at the top. A frame that came out of a paint
program would be a binary nobody could adjust without owning the same tool and
remembering what they did.

Pure standard library on purpose: this box has no imaging package and a build
tool that needs one installed is a build tool that stops working on the next
machine.
