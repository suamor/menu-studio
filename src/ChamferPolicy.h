// The geometry behind a chamfered ("cut corner") panel, kept free of both the
// engine and FLICK so the arithmetic can be tested on its own.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. FLICK's theme file cannot express a cut corner. Its
// whole geometry vocabulary is scalar - fRounding, fFrameRounding, fTabRounding,
// fButtonRounding, fGrabRounding, fScrollbarRounding, fPopupRounding - and every
// one of those feeds an ImGui corner ARC. There is no chamfer mode, no border
// image, no nine-slice. A theme author gets colours and a radius, which is why
// Vel'dun's own FLICK preset is a colour overhaul: that is the ceiling of the
// format, not a shortfall of the author. The notched frames in Vel'dun UI proper
// are Flash vector art inside 332 SWFs and nothing in the INI reaches that layer.
//
// So a cut corner has to be drawn by the plugin. FLICK exposes enough to do it:
// DrawQuadFilled takes four arbitrary points, DrawLine takes two, and a window
// opened with kNoDecoration | kNoBackground hands us the whole rect to paint.
//
// ⚠ THERE IS NO CONVEX-POLYGON FILL IN THE FLICK ABI, and that constraint shapes
// everything below. An octagon cannot be one primitive, so it has to be tiled,
// and every interior edge where two filled primitives meet is a place the fill
// can show a seam. Two facts about how ImGui fills decide how bad that is:
//
//   * AddRectFilled with zero rounding emits a hard quad with NO anti-aliased
//     fringe.
//   * AddQuadFilled and AddTriangleFilled go through AddConvexPolyFilled, which
//     feathers roughly a pixel OUTWARD from every edge when anti-aliased fill is
//     on (it is, by default).
//
// Mixing the two is the trap. A feathered quad edge laid against a hard rect
// edge puts partial coverage on top of full coverage, and on a translucent fill
// - Vel'dun's window is #1D1A17F4, and any child background is far more
// transparent than that - the overlap blends twice and reads as a darker line.
// Two feathered edges laid against each other each contribute about half
// coverage and sum back to one, which is the case that disappears.
//
// Hence: tile the octagon into THREE QUADS split by two vertical lines, and draw
// all three the same way. Three primitives, two interior seams, both of them
// quad-to-quad. The obvious alternative - a rect plus four corner triangles -
// costs seven primitives, eight seams, and mixes both fill paths. I have not put
// either in front of a screen, so treat the seam reasoning as reasoning; what is
// certain is the primitive and seam counts.
//
// If a panel ever needs to be genuinely seam-free over a transparent background,
// the escape hatch is not more geometry: load a texture whose alpha carries the
// chamfer and draw it with a single AddImage. That is one quad, one blend, and
// it buys authored corner ornaments as well. This header is the code-only route.
