    // MENU. EnsurePaused ran once, off that event, and gave up permanently when
    // RE::UI::GetMenu returned null - "not up yet" was treated as "nothing to
    // do". On a menu SWITCH the open event can fire before the new menu is
    // registered in the UI map, so the lookup misses, we never take the pause,
    // Skyrim Souls keeps the menu live, and the bubble reads UNPAUSED and stays
    // dormant. Field 2026-07-19, switching Inventory -> Magic:
    //
    //   ForcePause: InventoryMenu opened UNPAUSED ... re-paused (counter now 2)
    //   Bubble menu open but game is UNPAUSED (Skyrim Souls?) - bubble dormant
    //   ForcePause: InventoryMenu closed balanced by the engine (counter 0)
    //
    // with NO MagicMenu line at all between them - the take never happened.
    // That is the black backdrop and the running clock in the magic menu.
    //
    // So a take that cannot be completed now becomes PENDING and is retried from
    // the per-frame settle until it lands, the menu turns out to be genuinely
    // pausing, or the budget runs out. One-shot work driven off an event with no
    // ordering guarantee is the bug; per-frame reconciliation against the

    // side already uses.

    //
    // r16 FIELD NOTE (2026-07-20): the map-miss race this layer was built for
    // never fired in the verifying field run - every take succeeded first try,
    // and the switch bug turned out to live one step LATER (Souls strips the
    // flag after a successful take; see g_retakes). This stays as defense in
    // depth for the race it covers, but it is no longer believed to be the
    // switch bug's cause.

    // r16 - THE SWITCH BUG'S REAL MECHANISM (field 2026-07-20, r15 log). The r14
    // theory ("the open event beats the UI map, the take never happens") was
    // field-REFUTED: the take succeeded on every switch ("re-paused ... counter
    // now 1" each time, zero "queued for retry" lines). What actually happens is
    // one step later: Skyrim Souls ANSWERS the take. On a switch the outgoing
    // menu's pause is already released before the incoming menu's open event, so
    // for 1-2 frames the world genuinely runs - and in that window Souls strips
    // the flag we just set and takes the counter back. Timings, one per switch:
    // take 36.595 -> stripped by 36.600; take 37.640 -> stripped by 37.646;
    // take 38.482 -> stripped by 38.486. On a FRESH open the take lands inside
    // an already-paused window (TweenMenu bridges it), and a set flag under a
    // paused world holds indefinitely - 2.1s and 9.8s in the same log. So the
    // fight only exists in the churn window; win one round and it is over.
    //
    // Why re-taking is safe where the r6 re-assert was catastrophic: r6 re-set
    // the FLAG ONLY, every frame, forever - Souls answered each set with a
    // balanced strip (flag + decrement), so the net was -1 per frame until the
    // unsigned counter wrapped. A RE-TAKE is flag + increment, and the same
    // field log proves Souls' answer is balanced (counter went 1 -> 0 exactly
    // when the flag vanished, landing on the engine invariant: "counter 0, 0
    // open pausing menus"). Balanced take vs balanced strip = zero drift per
    // round even if we lose every round. Bounded anyway: kMaxRetakes rounds,
    // then concede and go dormant, which is exactly today's behavior.

    // r17 - THE FLAG WAR IS UNWINNABLE, SO STOP FIGHTING IT. The r16 retake ran
    // one field session (2026-07-20 09:14): 63 takes, 189 retakes, 63
    // concessions - Souls re-strips EVERY FRAME, even while the world is paused
    // (strips 6ms apart with the bubble armed). And the same log exposed that
    // the "fresh opens hold for seconds" evidence behind r16 was an illusion:
    // those sessions rode the TWEEN MENU's own rider pause while our flag was
    // long gone (the take said "counter now 2", the first armed tick already
    // read numPauses=1 - our +1 was stripped ~7ms in, every time, always).
    //
    // The decisive positive: 109 armed sessions ran FLAGLESS under rider pauses
    // with spin input, backdrop and declutter all working. The flag was never
    // the load-bearing part; the PAUSE is. So under Skyrim Souls we no longer
    // touch menu flags or numPausesGame at all - we hold RE::Main::freezeTime
    // (the `tfc 1` mechanism: world frozen, rendering/input/UI alive) for as
    // long as a covered menu is open. Menu Studio-owned views keep a short
    // linger to bridge the close->open gap of a menu switch; external camera
    // providers release immediately so SmoothCam can publish gameplay framing.
    // Souls has nothing to strip, there is no counter to drift, and the r6 bug
    // class cannot exist here.

    // The hold is guarded: taken only if freezeTime is currently false (a `tfc

    // close leaves the freeze re-asserted every frame with nothing able to
    // release it. That is a frozen world and no UI.
