        // read - it is which clip the graph latched, and nothing exposes that.
        //
        // The one difference left is the SHAPE OF TIME. r13's swap runs the
        // whole sheathe+redraw inside a SINGLE frame by calling UpdateAnimation
        // 96 times in a row. That advances graph TIME but never crosses a frame
        // BOUNDARY, so anything that re-picks a clip once per engine frame
        // never gets its chance. The state machine still reports ARRIVED,
        // because the weapon-state annotations fire inside the graph tick
        // regardless - which is precisely why every instrument said correct.
        //
        // If that is right then r13 is self-defeating. Sheathe+redraw was
        // rejected twice for costing ~2s of visible animation; r13 reversed the
        // rejection by making it invisible; and the very mechanism that hides
        // it is what stops the pose being re-picked. We bought invisibility
        // with correctness without noticing the trade.
        //
        // So run the same transition across REAL frames. Nothing new is needed
        // to drive it: Bubble already ticks the graph once per frame while a
        // menu is open, and the r36 freeze already exempts our own transition
        // through TransitionInFlight(). All this adds is the patience the pump
        // refuses to have.
        //
        // It IS visible, roughly a second per swap. That is the price of the
